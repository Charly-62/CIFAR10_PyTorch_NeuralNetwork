# Neural Network for CIFAR10 Classification

This repository contains a university (TUM) exercise where we implemented a simple neural network using PyTorch to classify images from the CIFAR10 dataset.

### Key Aspects:
- The project focused on three categories: **cat**, **dog**, and **ship**.
- The neural network was trained using backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent.
- The modelâ€™s performance varied across categories, with ships being easier to classify compared to cats and dogs (probably due to their more distinct features).

This exercise emphasizes the foundational steps in neural network development:
- Preprocessing and preparing data for training.
- Designing and implementing a simple model with PyTorch.
- Training the model using backpropagation.
- Evaluating accuracy and analyzing results.

It provides a hands-on introduction to neural networks and image classification.
